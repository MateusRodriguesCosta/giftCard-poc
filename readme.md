# This is current brainstorm of the API business logic:

### Create new gift card:
 Issue new card requires nothing, the system should allow zero balance at start and provide **secure generated code**.
### Bulk Operations (create and update):
 Each card must have valid code, balance, and status.
### Update gift card balance:
 The card number must be valid, and the status should allow the update.
### Update gift card expire date:
 The card number must be valid, and status should allow the update.
### Exchange balance between cards:
 both card numbers must be valid,
 the card need credit in balance to transfer,
 the status should allow the Exchange for both cards, and the cards must not be expired.
### Cancel/block gift card:
 The card number must be valid, cannot delete if in use, and balance should be zero.


# This is current temp architectural brainstorm:

### Layered Architecture
 I will split the app using a common architecture with controllers, services, and repositories. As I have two
 APIs to build (one Spring Boot and another .Net Core) I will start using this conventional one, and then work
 on a DDD or clean in the other.

### Batch/Bulk Operations
 First I'm gonna work with messaging tech, the RabbitMQ can be my choice here. I heard about Spring Batch, I can give it
 a try. I'm thinking that the volume of data here can be huge on Spring Sales or Black Fridays, it could have to process
 a thousand transactions per batch.

### Documentation
 The Springdoc is the best option today for Spring Boot API docs.

### Elastic
 In order to have a transactions history I will add elastic and kibana.
